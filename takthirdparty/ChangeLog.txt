** Release 2.12.1 - 2023-09-21
BUG FIXES
* libcurl is now built using --without-ca-path and --without-ca-bundle. 
  This fixes issues when curl is used on a different distribution (Linux)
  than the build host used as curl would fail trying to load the
  (non-existing) default ca bundle.  This change causes curl to defer to
  openssl's default CA set which will not fail when it does not exist,
  instead producing an empty set.  Uses of curl should be checked for
  expectation of system CAs being present.

** Release 2.12.0 - 2023-08-24
NOTABLE CHANGES
* Addition of ChangeLog document
* OpenSSL changed from straight OpenSSL 1.1.1t to QuicTLS 1.1.1v, a fork which
  exposes additional (otherwise internal) API. A side-effect of this is that
  library name on platforms using dynamic linking has changed from
  lib-1.1.1.{so,dll} to lib-81.1.1.1.{so,dll}
* ngtcp2 library added
MINOR CHANGES
* cmake version minimum is now 3.20.0
